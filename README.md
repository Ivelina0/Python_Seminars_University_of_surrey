# Python_Seminars_University_of_surrey
I complied some Python Data Science notebooks which i present to the MathSoc society at my university.

* **Sem 1** - we go through the basics of Python, installing packages and creating some basic plots
* **Sem 2** - we go through Linear Regression methods for finding the parameters such as gradient descent, normal equations and the scikit-learn package. We also look at some multivariabe regression and polynomial regression using scikit-learn. 
* **Sem 3** - we go through Classification methods with focus on K-Means. We then wrangle some customer transaction data and apply the K-means algorithm to it to do customer segmentation.
