# Python_Seminars_University_of_surrey
I complied some Python Data Science notebooks which i present to the MathSoc society at my university.

Sem 1 - we go through the basics of Python, installing packages and creating some basic plots
Sem 2 - we go through Linear Regression methods for finding the parameters such as gradient descent, normal equations and the scikit-learn package. We also look at some multivariabe regression and polynomial regression using scikit-learn.
