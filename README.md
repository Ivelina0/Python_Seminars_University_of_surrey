# Python_Seminars_University_of_surrey

Here you will be able to find powerpoint slides and notebooks I have made and compiled.

These slides I personally made and present to my peers at university. 

* **Part 1** - I go through the **basics of Python, installing packages and creating some basic plots
* **Part 2** - I go through **Linear Regression methods** for finding the parameters such as gradient descent, normal equations and the scikit-learn package. We also look at some multivariabe regression and polynomial regression using scikit-learn. 
* **Part 3** - I go through **Classification methods with focus on K-Means**. We then wrangle some customer transaction data and apply the K-means algorithm to it to do customer segmentation. 
* **Part 4** - I go through **MCMC the M-H method for sampling from posterior distributions**. I use the **PyMC3** package to do that and go through an small 'toy' example. (The code being similar to the *NASA Challanger* example in the book *Baysian Statisitcs for Hackers*.
